# Project: The Real Bill

https://therealbill-6c919.web.app/

## 1. OVERVIEW

Real Bill is a React-based website that allows users from all over the globe to gain access to information
regarding the calculation of purchasing power parity from other cities.

Purchasing power parity (PPP) is a measurement of prices in different countries that uses the prices of
specific goods to compare the absolute purchasing power of the countries' currencies.

The ability to select the location, currency, and city of the living desired in another country should be
available so that the entire calculation can be viewed.

We expect to see 5+ pages in this app. (/about, /livingIndex /therealbill (results), information on the lifestyle packages pages + contact).

###### 2. API

As for the API, I will be using Numbeo API with a provided key access from the engineer team with more
than 10.000 requests daily. It is worth pointing out that the key access will be hidden in the environment
documents in the visual code.

###### 3. GOALS
The objective of this project is to provide the results of the living costs of any desired cities in the world
according to the PPP calculation.
Authentication and storing data (local storage, sql) from living cost from saved cities.
As a bonus goal, a comparison between two or more cities will be used in the project to see how the living
costs compare.

Trello is used in this project to allow learning how to manage and plan the project from start to finish by
breaking down each step.
